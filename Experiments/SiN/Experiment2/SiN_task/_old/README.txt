Version of audiofiles, and spreadsheets for block order and flow that was used for s201 and s202.
Because the accuracy was too low, I made the stimuli easier (less degradation), which required me to create new spreadsheets as well.
For the sake of documentation, here are the old files.
The audiofiles are excluded from github behind a .gitignore file.
