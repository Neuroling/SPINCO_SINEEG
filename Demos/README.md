# DEMOS 
This folder has several interactive demos, including interactive python notebooks that use toolboxes like MNE 

## Editing and using the notebooks with MNE
- Download the file (you can open it in Github and then right click on 'raw' + save link as. Make sure the file extension is .ipynb )
- Go to you anaconda prompt, activate your environment where MNE is installed
- Install  jupyter **notebook**   using conda if you haven't done so  ```conda install notebook```
- Still in the environment prompt, go to the folder where you have the file:, e,.g., Â cd 'C:/users/me/mynotebooks'
- Then type ````jupyter notebook````
- A browser window should open showing you the folder content. Then you can open and edit the .ipynb file you want
