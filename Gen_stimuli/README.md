# Generation of Stimuli and Other Required Files
author: samuelmull

The scripts in these folders contain everything needed to generate the stimuli for the experiment, as well as any other files needed to run the experiment (i.e. the images for the selection screen, and the spreadsheets for stimulus presentation).

For a thorough explanation of the pipeline, including what scripts need to be executed at what point, see **SINEEG/Docs/Procedures/Flowchart_stimuliGeneration_Experiment2.pdf**. Refer to that flowchart if possible.

### Folder organisation
The folders are numbered in order of execution.  
Within each folder, you will find a README file and the scripts.
The scripts used to generate files for the second part of the experiment 
, which are also numbered in order of execution.
Files in which the order-number is followed by *_exp2_* are used
